# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application allows users to know what the weather will be for any city for the next 5 days, including the current day. After properly searching for any existing city, the user will be presented with a 5-day forecast that presents them with the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather that day through an icon. This application is important to create because our schedules are all based around the weather. Everyone plans according to the weather in upcoming dates.
